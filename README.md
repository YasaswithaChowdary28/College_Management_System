# College_Management_System
##Project Overview
The College Management System is a Python-based application designed to manage colleges, students, and teachers. The system allows administrators to create colleges, add teachers and students, and securely display their details using OTP (One-Time Password) verification. The system provides a menu-driven interface to simplify user interaction. It uses smtplib to send OTPs via email for authentication purposes.

##Key Features:
Create Colleges: Assigns unique IDs and names to colleges.
Add Teachers: Add teachers with their subject specialization and email, with OTP-based verification.
Add Students: Add students to the system with their branch and email, also secured by OTP verification.
Display Teacher and Student Details: View the details of teachers and students, accessible only after OTP verification.
Secure OTP Verification: Ensures that only authorized users can view sensitive information.

##Technologies Used:
Python: Main programming language used to build the system.
smtplib: Used for sending OTP verification emails to users.
email.mime: For formatting the OTP email.
random: For generating random OTPs for user verification.

##Requirements:
Python 3.x
smtplib (built-in Python library)
email.mime (built-in Python library)

##How It Works:
1. Create College:
Input the college ID and name to create a new college.
The system ensures that the college ID is unique.
2. Add Teacher:
Input the college ID, teacher’s name, email, and subject.
An OTP will be sent to the teacher's email for verification before adding them to the system.
3. Add Student:
Input the college ID, student’s name, email, and branch.
An OTP will be sent to the student's email for verification before adding them to the system.
4. Display Teacher/Student Details:
Input the college ID and view the details of teachers or students associated with that college, accessible only after OTP verification.
5. Exit:
The user can choose to exit the program at any time.

##Example of OTP Email:
When adding a teacher or student, an email will be sent to the provided email address with the following format:

Subject: OTP for verification
Body: 
OTP for Validation is <OTP_Value> 
Thank You.
After receiving the OTP, the user is prompted to enter the code for verification. If the OTP is correct, the teacher or student is successfully added to the college.

##Security Considerations:
Ensure you use a dedicated email account for sending OTPs in a production environment.
Do not hard-code sensitive information (like email credentials) in the source code. Use environment variables or a configuration file for better security practices.

##Future Improvements:
Database Integration: Integrate with a database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL) to persist data across sessions.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Create a GUI for a more user-friendly experience.
SMS OTP: Implement OTP verification via SMS using third-party services (e.g., Twilio).
